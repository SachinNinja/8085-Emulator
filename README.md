# 8085-Emulator

This is an emulator for the Intel 8085 microprocessor, implemented in C++. It has two modes of operation: run mode and debugger mode. It can execute all of the 8085 commands.

## Run Mode
In run mode, the emulator simply executes the program loaded into memory without any user interaction. This is useful for running programs that do not require any debugging or monitoring.

## Debugger Mode

In debugger mode, the emulator provides a command-line interface for monitoring and debugging the program. This includes the ability to set breakpoints, step through the program one instruction at a time, and examine the contents of memory and registers.
